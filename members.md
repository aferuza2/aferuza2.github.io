- Maftuna Abdukadirova (High School student)
- Ravi Bhagat (High School student)
    - Ravi Bhagat is a student at Ann Sobrato HS in Morgan Hill, CA. Since he was 6 years old, he said that he want 
    to be an engineer. Ravi moved to Silicon Valley a few years ago, and he is astonished at all the new opportunities here. 
    He plays console and PC games from time to time and sometimes he wonders what it's like to develop a game. In addition, 
    the thought of being multilingual sounds fun, so he enjoys learning Spanish in school and Hindi on the side. To him, 
    a playing card deck is one of the most useful things you can have if you're stranded on an island with a few other 
    people.
